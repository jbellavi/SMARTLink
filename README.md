## Builing the site

### Front end
To build the front end of the site, you will first need to [install `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
Once you have `npm` installed, clone this directory and navigate into the root. Run
	`npm install`
to set up all the packages used in this project. Then, if you do not already have [`gulp`](https://gulpjs.com/) installed, run
	`npm install -g gulp`
Now that you have all of the tools you need installed, you can simply run
	`gulp`
each time you would like to build the project.

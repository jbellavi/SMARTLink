		<p class="paragraph">This piece of canvas is your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let the paint work. Brown is such a nice color.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">We'll play with clouds today. It is a lot of fun. Very easy to work these to death. Let your imagination be your guide. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>

		<p class="paragraph">Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. And just raise cain. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>
